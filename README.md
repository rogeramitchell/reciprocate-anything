# Reciprocate Anything

## Abstract
* Junction objects between the same objects often require a reciprocal record to display in one related list on a page layout
* Reciprocal records must do one of the following:
	* Copy exact values
	* Translate values based on a dictionary
	* Not copy values at all
* These situations can occur for a variety of use cases
	* Contact relationships (similar to NPSP Relationships)
	* Account partnerships (similar to the second class Partner standard object)
	* Inventory transfers

## Ideal State Features
* Users can define the following as records of an object / custom setting / custom metadata type
	* Junction object to act upon
	* Criteria of records for which reciprocals are created
	* Mapping the reciprocation of fields 
	* Defining translations for specified fields
